This is a blog based website made with python’s web framework <b>django</b>. 

Made for a <b>client</b> of mine <a href="https://www.youtube.com/c/DiamondNepalEChannel">Youtube (3.5K Subscribers)</a>. This website lets the user make a blog post as easily like other social medias. It has been made solely for the purpose of making it <b>simple</b> for non-technical people, who just want to reach out to people from their website just as they would do from other social medias.

<b>Category</b> can be chosen so that the posts get separated accordingly. 

Admin can <b>add additional users</b><br>
Reputable users can be given a <b>verified badge</b> so that the visitor of the website can believe in what they post.

The administrator of the website has a separate <b>dedicated admin page</b> from where they can control everything on their website, from deleting a post to changing user’s details to editing posts, editing or removing comments and much more.
